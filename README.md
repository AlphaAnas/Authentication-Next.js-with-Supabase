# Next.js + Supabase Authentication Example

This repository provides a clear, step-by-step implementation of basic authentication in a Next.js application using Supabase. It includes essential features such as user signup, login, and protected routes.

## Features

- **User Signup & Login**: Secure authentication flows with Supabase.
- **Protected Routes**: Restricts access to authenticated users only.
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**:
  - [Login Page](login/page.tsx): Demonstrates how to fetch user data on the server during login.
  - [Private Page](private/page.tsx): Shows server-side authentication and data fetching for protected content.

## Coming Soon

- Client-side authentication: Example of managing sessions and authentication state entirely in the browser.
- Authentication in API Routes: How to secure custom API endpoints with Supabase auth.
- Sessions vs. Cookies: Explanation and demonstration of authentication using both approaches.
